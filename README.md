ArduinoPainter
==================
Arduino controller for a generic printing machine.
It's on a early development status.

It's thought to be used with my Android paint tool: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBtlcxkml6k (project repository: https://github.com/santicastro/AndroidGCodePainter)


Some working samples:

The electronics diagrams are not yet available, they will be soon.

The 3D printable parts of the marker painter are available in https://github.com/santicastro/3DModels/tree/master/WallPainter but it's a prototype and not well organized, sorry.
